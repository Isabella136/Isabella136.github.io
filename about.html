<h1>About Nathalie</h1>
<p>
    Nathalie Bonin is a third year Computer Science PhD student at the 
    <a href="https://umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>. She is fortunate 
    to have <a href="https://pop-lab.org/">Dr. Mihai Pop</a> as her advisor, with 
    whom she had the opportunity to work on the NCBI Pathogen Detection plasmid 
    reconstruction project (in collaboration with <a href="https://acollens.github.io/">
    Adena Collens</a>, third-year PhD student in UMD's Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, 
    and Systematics program, and Dr. Seth Commichaux, Bioinformatics Researcher at 
    the FDA and former Computational Biology PhD student at UMD) and on robustness to 
    data artifacts in hybrid alignment-deep learning (in collaboration with 
    <a href="https://kamalavarma.com/">Kamala Varma</a>, sixth-year PhD candidate 
    in UMD's Computer Science program). Furthemore, during her time at UMD, she also 
    had the occasion to work with <a href="https://www.zierdenlab.org/">Dr. Hannah 
    Zierden</a> and Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering undergrad Karolina Akelaitis 
    on their research in extracellular vesicles and the vaginal microbiome.

    Before joining UMD, Nathalie went to the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">
    University of Florida</a> for her undergrad where she earned a dual bachelor 
    degree in Microbiology & Cell Science and in Computer Science, with a minor in 
    Spanish. She had the pleasure to be an NSF REU student advised by <a href=
    "https://www.christinaboucher.com/">Dr. Christina Boucher</a>. The research 
    projects she undertook during her time in the Boucher Lab included the 
    recognition of antimicrobial-resistance-conferring structural variants (with the 
    collaboration of other researchers in the <a href="https://www.meglab.org/">
    Microbial Ecology Group</a>). Also during her time with Christina Boucher, 
    Nathalie had the occasion to work with <a href="https://slizovskiy.com/">Dr. Ilya 
    Slizovskiy</a> and his advisor <a href="https://www.thenoyeslab.org">Dr. Noelle 
    Noyes</a> from the University of Minnesota on their investigations of target-
    enriched long-read sequencing of resistomes and mobilomes.
