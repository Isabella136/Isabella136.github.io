<h1>About Nathalie</h1>
<p>
    Nathalie Bonin is finishing her first year as a Computer Science PhD student 
    at the <a href="https://umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>. She is fortunate 
    to have <a href="https://pop-lab.org/">Dr. Mihai Pop</a> as her advisor, with 
    whom she has the opportunity to work on two projects: the NCBI Pathogen Detection 
    plasmid reconstruction project (in collaboration of Adena Collens, first-year PhD 
    student at UMD's Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics program, and Dr. 
    Seth Commichaux, Bioinformatics Researcher at the FDA and former Computational 
    Biology PhD student at UMD), and the phylogenetic compression project (in the 
    collaboration of NaKyung Lee, second-year PhD student at UMD's Computer Science 
    program). Furthemore, during her time at UMD, she also had the occasion to work 
    with <a href="https://www.zierdenlab.org/">Dr. Hannah Zierden</a> and Chemical & 
    Biomolecular Engineering undergrad Karolina Akelaitis on their research in 
    extracellular vesicles and the vaginal microbiome.
</p>
<p>
    Before joining UMD, Nathalie went to the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">
    University of Florida</a> for her undergrad where she earned a dual bachelor 
    degree in Microbiology & Cell Science and in Computer Science, with a minor in 
    Spanish. She had the pleasure to be an NSF REU student advised by <a href=
    "https://www.christinaboucher.com/">Dr. Christina Boucher</a>. The research 
    projects she undertook during her time in the Boucher Lab included the 
    recognition of antimicrobial-resistance-conferring structural variants (with the 
    collaboration of other researchers in the <a href="https://www.meglab.org/">
    Microbiol Ecology Group</a>). Also during her time with Christina Boucher, 
    Nathalie had the occasion to work with <a href="https://slizovskiy.com/">Dr. Ilya 
    Slizovskiy</a> and his advisor <a href="https://www.thenoyeslab.org">Dr. Noelle 
    Noyes</a> from the University of Minnesota on their investigations of target-
    enriched long-read sequencing of resistomes and mobilomes.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to research, Nathalie is very involved as the Diversity, Equity, and 
    Inclusion (DEI) Chair in the Computer Science Graduate Student Council (GradCo). 
    She also takes an active role in the Graduate Labor Union (GLU) especially with 
    regards to organizing her fellow grad workers.
